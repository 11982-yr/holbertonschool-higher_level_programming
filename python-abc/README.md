# Python – Abstract Base Classes (ABC)

This project is part of the Higher Level Programming curriculum at Holberton School and focuses on abstraction, interfaces, and advanced object-oriented design in Python using Abstract Base Classes (ABCs).

The goal of this project is to understand how abstraction enforces structure in object-oriented programming and how Python supports interface-like behavior through the abc module, mixins, and duck typing.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you should be able to:
* Understand abstraction and why it is useful
* Use the abc module to define abstract base classes
* Implement abstract methods
* Apply duck typing principles
* Create and use mixins
* Design flexible and extensible class hierarchies
* Track behavior across inherited classes

## Requirements
* Python 3.10+
* Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
* Code follows PEP8 / pycodestyle
* All files end with a newline
* First line of each Python file:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/python3
```
* All scripts are executable

## Usage
* Each script can be executed independently:
```bash
python3 task_00_abc.py
```
* Some tasks are designed to be tested using custom test cases to verify class behavior.

## Concepts Covered
* Abstract base classes
* Duck typing
* Mixins
* Multiple inheritance
* Method resolution order (MRO)
* Custom iterators
* Interface-like design patterns
