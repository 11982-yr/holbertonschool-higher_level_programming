# Python - Hello, World

This project is part of the Holberton School Foundations curriculum (v2.1, Part 2).
It introduces the basics of Python programming—how to run Python scripts, work with strings, format output, and follow the official Python style guide (pycodestyle).

## Features
- Basic Python syntax demonstration
- Simple print statement
- Great first project for new developers

## Project Structure
This project lives inside the repository:
```c
holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/
└── python-hello_world/
     ├── 2-print.py
     ├── 3-print_number.py
     ├── 4-print_float.py
     ├── 5-print_string.py
     ├── 6-concat.py
     ├── 7-edges.py
     ├── 8-concat_edges.py
     └── 9-easter_egg.py
```
Each file corresponds to a specific learning task.

## Requirements
Python scripts must start with:
```c
#!/usr/bin/python3
```
- Files must be executable
- Code tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Python 3.8.*
- Style checked with pycodestyle 2.7.*
- No loops or conditionals unless allowed
- .md README required at project root

## Tasks Summary
0. Hello, print
- Print exactly:
```c
"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle
```

1. Print integer
- Print a number with a message using f-strings.

2. Print float
- Print a float with 2 decimal precision, using f-strings.

3. Print string
- Print a string 3 times and then its first 9 characters.

4. Play with strings
- Concatenate two variables to print:
```c
Welcome to Holberton School!
```

5. Copy - Cut - Paste
- Use slicing to extract specific parts of a word.

6. Create a new sentence
- Print: object-oriented programming with Python
using slicing only—no new variables.

7. Easter Egg
Print The Zen of Python in ≤ 98 characters.

## How to Run
```c
chmod +x <filename>.py
./<filename>.py
```
or
```c
python3 <filename>.py
```

## About the Project

This is your first step into Python at Holberton School / Tuwaiq Academy.
You will learn good coding habits early, practice slicing and formatting, and build confidence with Python fundamentals.
