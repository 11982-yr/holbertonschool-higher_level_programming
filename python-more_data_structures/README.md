# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

This project focuses on strengthening your understanding of Python’s advanced data structures, particularly sets and dictionaries, as well as functional programming tools like lambda, map, filter, and reduce.
By the end of this project, you will be comfortable using these tools efficiently and understanding when they are most appropriate.

- **0-square_matrix_simple.py**

Function: ``` square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]) ```

Goal: Return a new matrix where each value is the square of the original.

- **1-search_replace.py**

Function: ``` search_replace(my_list, search, replace) ```

Goal: Return a new list where all occurrences of search are replaced with replace.

- **2-uniq_add.py**

Function: ``` uniq_add(my_list=[]) ```

Goal: Return the sum of all unique integers in a list.

- **3-common_elements.py**

Function: ``` common_elements(set_1, set_2) ```

Goal: Return a set of elements that appear in both sets.

- **4-only_diff_elements.py**

Function: ``` only_diff_elements(set_1, set_2) ```

Goal: Return a set of elements that are present in exactly one set, not both.

- **5-number_keys.py**

Function: ``` number_keys(a_dictionary) ```

Goal: Return the number of keys in a dictionary.

- **6-print_sorted_dictionary.py**

Function: ``` print_sorted_dictionary(a_dictionary) ```

Goal: Print the dictionary sorted by keys (alphabetically).

- **7-update_dictionary.py**

Function: ``` update_dictionary(a_dictionary, key, value) ```

Goal: Add or update a key/value pair in a dictionary.

- **8-simple_delete.py**

Function: ``` simple_delete(a_dictionary, key="") ```

Goal: Delete a key from a dictionary if it exists.

- **9-multiply_by_2.py**

Function: ``` multiply_by_2(a_dictionary) ```

Goal: Return a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.

- **10-best_score.py**

Function: ``` best_score(a_dictionary) ```

Goal: Return the key with the highest integer value.

- **11-multiply_list_map.py**

Function: ``` multiply_list_map(my_list=[], number=0) ```

Goal: Return a new list where all values are multiplied by number, using map (no loops).

- **12-roman_to_int.py**

Function: ``` roman_to_int(roman_string) ```

Goal: Convert a Roman numeral string into an integer.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without needing Google:

**General**

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What sets are and how to use them
- The most common set methods and how/when to use them
- When to use sets versus lists
- How to iterate through a set
- What dictionaries are and how to use them
- When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
- What keys are in a dictionary
- How to iterate over a dictionary
- What a lambda function is
- The purpose of map(), filter(), and reduce() functions

## Resources

You are encouraged to read/watch:

- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- All files must end with a new line
- The first line of every file must be:
```shell
#!/usr/bin/python3
```
- You must include a README.md at the root of your project
