# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

This project focuses on strengthening your understanding of Python’s advanced data structures, particularly sets and dictionaries, as well as functional programming tools like lambda, map, filter, and reduce.
By the end of this project, you will be comfortable using these tools efficiently and understanding when they are most appropriate.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without needing Google:

**General**

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What sets are and how to use them
- The most common set methods and how/when to use them
- When to use sets versus lists
- How to iterate through a set
- What dictionaries are and how to use them
- When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
- What keys are in a dictionary
- How to iterate over a dictionary
- What a lambda function is
- The purpose of map(), filter(), and reduce() functions

## Resources
