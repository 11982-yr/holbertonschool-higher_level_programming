# Python - More Classes and Objects

This project continues your journey into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.
You will learn more advanced concepts such as class attributes, static methods, class methods, printing behaviors (```__str__```, ```__repr__```), and object destruction.

## Description
- This project expands upon the basics of Python classes and objects.
- You will practice:
    - Designing more complex classes
    - Implementing class-level features
    - Differentiating object attributes vs. class attributes
    - Using properties, getters, setters
    - Overloading special methods
    - Understanding and applying OOP principles
It also includes quizzes to reinforce learning.

## Resources
- You are expected to read or watch the following:

**Object-Oriented Programming**
- Object Oriented Programming (read up to Inheritance, excluded)

**Python Class Fundamentals**
- Read only these sections of the second article:
    - General Introduction
    - First-class Everything
    - A Minimal Class in Python
    - Attributes
    - Methods
    - The ```__init__``` Method
    - Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
    - ```__str__``` and ```__repr__``` Methods
    - Public, Protected, and Private Attributes
    - Destructor

**Additional Topics**
- Class and Instance Attributes
- ```classmethod``` and ```staticmethod```
- Properties vs Getters and Setters (especially: Public instead of Private Attributes)
- ```str``` vs ```repr```
