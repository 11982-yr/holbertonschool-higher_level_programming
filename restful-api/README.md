# RESTful API

This project is part of the Higher Level Programming curriculum at Holberton School and focuses on building and understanding RESTful APIs, HTTP communication, and basic API security.

The goal of this project is to learn how web services work, how clients and servers communicate over HTTP, and how to design secure and structured APIs using Python.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you should be able to:
* Understand REST architecture principles
* Work with HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* Use the requests library to interact with APIs
* Build basic HTTP servers
* Create RESTful APIs using Flask
* Handle JSON data correctly
* Implement basic authentication and JWT-based security
* Validate user input in API endpoints

| File                        | Description                                                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `task_02_requests.py`       | Uses the `requests` library to interact with external APIs |
| `task_03_http_server.py`    | Implements a basic HTTP server with multiple endpoints     |
| `task_04_flask.py`          | Builds a RESTful API using Flask with user routes          |
| `task_05_basic_security.py` | Implements Basic Authentication and JWT security           |
| `README.md`                 | Project documentation                                      |

## Requirements
* Python 3.10+
* Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
* Code follows PEP8 / pycodestyle
* All files end with a newline
* First line of each Python file:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/python3
```
* All scripts are executable

## Usage
* **Requests Example**
```bash
python3 task_02_requests.py
```

* **HTTP Server**
```bash
python3 task_03_http_server.py
```
* Then access endpoints using a browser or ```curl```.

* **Flask API**
```bash
python3 task_04_flask.py
```
* The API will start on ```http://127.0.0.1:5000```.

* **Security (Basic Auth & JWT)**
```bash
python3 task_05_basic_security.py
```
* Test authentication-protected endpoints using ```curl``` or Postman.

## Concepts Covered
* REST principles
* HTTP protocol
* Client-server architecture
* JSON APIs
* Flask framework
* Authentication and authorization
* API security best practices
