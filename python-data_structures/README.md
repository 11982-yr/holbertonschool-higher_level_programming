# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Project Overview 

This project focuses on fundamental Python data structures—lists and tuples. You will learn how they work, when to use each, and how they compare to other sequence types such as strings.

By the end of this project, you should have a solid understanding of how to manipulate sequences effectively in Python, using both built-in techniques and best practices.

- **0. Print a list of integers**:

A function that prints all integers of a list.

- 1. Secure access to an element in a list

A function that retrieves an element from a list.

- **2. Replace element**:

 A function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position.

- **3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!**:
 
A function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.

- **4. Replace in a copy**:

A function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.

- **5. Can you C me now?**:
 
A function that removes all characters c and C from a string.

- **6. Lists of lists = Matrix**:

A function that prints a matrix of integers.

- **7. Tuples addition**:

A function that adds 2 tuples.

- **8. More returns!**:

A function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

- **9. Find the max**:

A function that finds the biggest integer of a list.

- **10. Only by 2**:

A function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.

- **11. Delete at**:

A function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.

- **12. Switch**:

Completes the source code in order to switch value of a and b

## Resources

Before starting, you may want to review:
- 3.1.3. Lists
- Data Structures (up to 5.3. Tuples and Sequences)
- Learn to Program 6: Lists
- These materials will help reinforce the concepts covered in this project.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts clearly and without external help:

**General Concepts**

- What lists are and how to use them
- Similarities and differences between strings and lists
- The most common list methods and how to use them
- Using lists as stacks and queues
- Understanding list comprehensions and their use cases
- What tuples are and how to use them
- How to decide between lists vs tuples
- Understanding the concept of a sequence
- What tuple packing is
- What sequence unpacking is
- The purpose and use of the del statement

## Requirements

**Python Scripts**

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- All files must end with a new line
- The first line of every file must be:
```shell
#!/usr/bin/python3
```
- You must include a README.md at the root of your project
- Your code must follow pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
