# Python – Serialization

This project is part of the Higher Level Programming curriculum at Holberton School and focuses on data serialization and deserialization in Python.

The goal of this project is to understand how Python objects can be converted into formats suitable for storage or transmission and later reconstructed back into Python objects.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you should be able to:
* Understand what serialization and deserialization are
* Serialize and deserialize Python objects using different formats
* Work with common data interchange formats (JSON, CSV, XML)
* Use Python’s pickle module
* Read from and write to files
* Understand the advantages and limitations of each serialization format

## Files Description
File	Description
| File                             | Description                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `task_00_basic_serialization.py` | Demonstrates basic object serialization                 |
| `task_01_pickle.py`              | Serializes and deserializes objects using `pickle`      |
| `task_02_csv.py`                 | Serializes data to and from CSV format                  |
| `task_03_xml.py`                 | Serializes data to and from XML format                  |
| `task_04_net.py`                 | Demonstrates serialization in a network-related context |

## Requirements
* Python 3.10+
* Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
* Code follows PEP8 / pycodestyle
* All files end with a newline
* First line of each Python file:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/python3
```
* All scripts are executable

## Usage
Each task can be run independently. Example:
```bash
python3 task_01_pickle.py
```
For file-based tasks, ensure the script has proper read/write permissions.

## Concepts Covered
- Object serialization
- JSON, CSV, and XML formats
- Binary serialization with ```pickle```
- Data persistence#
- Data interchange between systems
