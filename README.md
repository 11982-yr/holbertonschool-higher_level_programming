# Higher Level Programming – Holberton School

This repository contains all Higher Level Programming projects completed as part of the Foundations v2.1 curriculum at Holberton School.

The projects span multiple programming languages and concepts including Python, SQL, data structures, object-oriented programming, and more.
Each directory represents a separate project with its own tasks and detailed README.
